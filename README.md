## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  **Python Environment**: Ensure you have a Python 3.10+ environment installed.
      ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TianDongL/DiffPipeForge.git
    ```

  **Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision==0.22.1 torchaudio==2.7.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    

### Launching the App

Simply run the `start.bat` file in the project root:
```bash
./start.bat
```

### Your First Training Session

1.  **Select/Create Project**: Launch the app and create a new project or open an existing folder.
2.  **Configure Dataset**: Point to your image or video folders and set your desired resolutions.
3.  **Setup Model**: Choose your architecture (e.g., Flux or Wan) and provide the model paths.
4.  **Optimizer & Training**: Adjust your learning rates and batch sizes.
5.  **Start Training**: Click the "Start Training" button and monitor your progress in the "Training Log" or "Monitor" tabs.
